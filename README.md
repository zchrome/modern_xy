Max for Live X/Y with modern sensibilities

> "Imagen X/Y Pad was updated and still Max for Live comedy plugin today?"

A small and simple re-creation of the OG M4L device "XY Pad" from back in the days.
Control two (or four) parameters with the X and Y values of a 2d cursor.

## Features and improvments

- **Modernized** look and feel
- **Current day** (2025) style of **mapping interface**, featuring **bipolar** and **unioplar modulation** or **remote parameter takeover**. Based on code in the stock _Expression Control_ device
- **Output curve** controls, with a switch between one- or two segment ("S-shaped") Bezier curves
- **Two additional** mapping outputs, with **selectable source** (either X or Y axis), with a small graphical (LCD-style) dragable interface (_pictslider_!)
- **Snapback mode:** in this mode, the cursor snaps back to the set coordinates when the mouse is released. Settable easing time (0 - 2000 ms) and curve
- **Inertia mode:** smooths the cursor logarithmically (and spawns a spooky ghost cursor to represent the smoothed signal), simulating inertia. With setable smoothing time
- **Global depth** control

> "Imagen X/Y Pad was updated and still Max for Live comedy plugin today?"

A small and simple re-creation of the OG M4L device "XY Pad" from back in the days.
Control two (or four) parameters with the X and Y values of a 2d cursor.

Built with Max 8.6.4 and Ableton Live 12. No guarantees on other versions!

Download from the redist folder or [releases](https://github.com/zchrome/modern_xy/releases/tag/0.1.1) tab.

## Features and improvments

- **Modernized look and feel**
- **Contemporary** (2025) **style mapping interface**, featuring bipolar and unipolar modulation or remote parameter takeover; based on code from the stock _Expression Control_ device
- **Output curve controls** with a switch between **single- or two-segment** (“S-shaped”) Bézier curves and a **small graphical** (LCD-style) draggable interface (pictslider!) to control curve shape
- **Two additional mapping outputs**, with **selectable source** (either X or Y axis)
- **Snapback mode:** in this mode, the cursor snaps back to the set coordinates when the mouse is released; includes adjustable easing time (0–2000 ms) and curve control
- **Inertia mode:** smooths the cursor movement logarithmically (and spawns a spooky ghost cursor to represent the smoothed signal!), simulating inertia; includes adjustable smoothing time
- Global **depth control**
